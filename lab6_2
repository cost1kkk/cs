m= during all these years, cryptology was acquiring a taint that lingerseven today—the
conviction in the minds of many people that cryptologyis a black art, a form of occultism whose
practitioner must, in william f.friedman's apt phrase, "perforce commune daily with dark spirits
toaccomplish his feats of mental jiu-jitsu."in part it is a kind of guilt by association.
from the early days of itsexistence, cryptology had served to obscure critical portions of
writingsdealing with the potent subject of magic—divinations, spells, curses,whatever
conferred supernatural powers on its sorcerers. anotherimportant factor was the confusion of
cryptology with the jewishkabbalah.but, important as all these were, the view that cryptology
is blackmagic in itself springs ultimately from a superficial resemblance betweencryptology and
divination. extracting an intelligible message fromciphertext seemed to be exactly the same
thing as obtaining knowledgeby examining the flight of birds, the location of stars and
planets, thelength and intersections of lines in the hand, the entrails of sheep,
theposition of dregs in a teacup. in all of these, the wizard-like operatordraws sense from
grotesque, unfamiliar, and apparently meaninglesssigns. he makes known the unknown.all this
stained cryptology so deeply with the dark hues of esoterismthat some of them still persist,
noticeably coloring the public image ofcryptology. people still think cryptanalysis
mysterious. book dealers stilllist cryptology under "occult." and in 1940 the united
states conferredupon its japanese diplomatic cryptanalyses the codename magic. in none of
the secret writing thus far was there any sustainedcryptanalysis. occasional cases, yes. but
of any science of cryptanalysis,there was nothing. only cryptography existed. and therefore
cryptology,which involves both cryptography and cryptanalysis, had not yet come into being sofar
as all these cultures—including the western —were concerned.cryptology was born among the
arabs. they were the first to discoverand write down the methods of cryptanalysis. the
people that explodedout of arabia in the 600s and flamed over vast areas of the known
worldswiftly engendered one of the highest civilizations that history -had yetseen.
science flowered. arab medicine and mathematics became the bestin the world—from the
latter, in fact, comes the word "cipher." practicalarts flourished. administrative
techniques developed. the exuberantcreative energies of such a culture, excluded by its
religion from paintingor sculpture, and inspired by it to an explication of the holy
koran,poured into literary pursuits. storytelling, exemplified by sheherazade'sthousand and
one nights, word-riddles, rebuses, puns, anagrams, andsimilar games abounded; grammar became a major
study. and includedwas secret writing.after explaining that one may write in an unknown language
to obtainsecrecy, ibn ad-duraihim, according to qalqashandi, gave seven systemsof ciphers.
this list encompassed, for the first time in cryptography, bothtransposition and
substitution ciphers. moreover, one system is the firstknown cipher ever to provide more
than one substitute for a plaintextletter. remarkable and important as this is, however, it
is overshadowed by what follows— the firstexposition on cryptanalysis in history.
